Copy this directory to a directory at the same level, but one that
uses your presentation group name, before submitting your pull
request. Make sure to add and commit with git all supporting files in
this new directory.

The actual talk should go in [`talk.md`](talk.md) -- you will want to
keep that name. Any other supporting resources, such as images, should
go in this directory too.
